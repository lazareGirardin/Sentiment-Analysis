# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews. The aim is for a neural network to classify reviews left by users.

Workload (approximation):
  - 40% coding
  - 60% Analysis of methods and results
  
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data (Reviews labeled in 5 classes, from Rottentomatoes)

(Eventually use IMDB dataset)

Pre-Processing in juypter-notebook Exploration.ipynb:
  - Keep only full sentences
  - Binarize Sentiment (1 or 0)
  - Tokenize sentences
  - Remove stopwords and similar
  - ...

To Do:

  - simple word2Vec, GloVe, ...  pre-processing
  - Compare performance with different pre-processing
  - Compare performance with different algorithms (simple perceptron, Neural Nets, basic ML algo?)
  - Best performance: upload on Kaggle to compare with existing solutions?
